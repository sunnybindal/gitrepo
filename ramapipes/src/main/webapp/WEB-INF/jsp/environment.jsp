		<span class="liner"></span> Following are a list of tests performed
		regularly on the Hoses thus produced in our factory :

		<ul>
			<li>Bursting Pressure Test : This test checks the performance of
				the hose under Pressure and grade the Hoses according to the working
				pressure ratings. We manufacture hoses with Bursting pressure rating
				up to 120 kgf/sqcm</li>
			<li>Low Temperature Flexibility Test : It tests the Hose
				performance when used in Sub Zero Low temperatures up to minus 10
				degree Celsius.Hoses produced by us are processed in such
				formulations that the can be easily used in all weather conditions
				with some hoses developed to be used in extreme weather conditions.</li>
			<li>Bending Radius Test : We check through this test weather the
				hose cross section collapses or not when the Hose is bend in certain
				radius for usage as Hose Reel. This enable the design of Hose Reel
				Diameter for uninterrupted fluid flow.</li>
			<li>Loss of Mass : We test through this loss of mass in hose
				when exposed to a heated chamber under 120 degree Celsius for 24
				hours. This grades the performance of Hose with respect to
				weathering and life of the Hose.</li>
